Program for stock analyzing (the data is for Vietnamese companies)

VII is for reading and searching through the data from the database:
  Run the .java file in 
  ...\Stock-analyzing\Vietnam Intelligent Investor\src\vietnam\intelligent\investor
  will give you my program as you can search through the database for company infor and if you click on Edit/View Editor, you can choose fields and value to filter out companies that fit

jbdc is a collection of code and libraries I used for analyzing and uploading the data to MySQL server

  Import_All_Annual is the main part I run to analyze and upload everything to the server from other classes.

Other features as user log in and in the Menu File will be added later.
